/*

base model combine takes 240 passes * 300 seconds on 10 acres (660 X 660 ft)
8.7 feet augerLength * 240 = 2088 square feet per pass?
240 passes * 5 minutes = 72000 seconds

660 ft / 240 passes = 2.75 feet per pass
you get 2.75 feet per pass with a 8.7 ft augerLength
2.75/8.7 = feetPerPass (0.31609195 extra feet of width per pass)

feetPerPass = 2.75 + (extraFeet * 2.75 / 8.7)

numPasses = 660 ft / feetPerPass

timeTaken = numPasses * 300

so augerLengthLength = 2088 / numberOfPasses
